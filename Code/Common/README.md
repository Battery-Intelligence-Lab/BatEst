The most commonly adjusted scripts are:

- `cell_parameters` which sets the common cell parameters, including the location of OCP data/functions
- `cell_protocol` which can be used to define the experimental protocol
- `code_switches` contains general settings which can be turned on or off

The other scripts are divided into two folders:

- Common contains the scripts to create the model, run the estimation and process the output
- Postprocessing contains functions which can be used to analyse the output
