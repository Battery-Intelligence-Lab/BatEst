# BatEst Models

The models have different numbers of states, although the first state is always the state of charge (SOC) and the first output is always the voltage.

The EHM has two states: SOC and CSC.
The EHMT has four states: SOC, CSC, Tc and Ts.
The OCV and ROCV models have one state: SOC.
The OCVT model has three states: SOC, Tc and Ts.
The RORC model has two states: SOC and Vrc.
